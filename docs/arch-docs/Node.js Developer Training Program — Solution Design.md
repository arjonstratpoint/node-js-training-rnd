# Node.js Developer Training Program — Solution Design

Oct 2, 2026 · @Ryan Angelo

## Overview

The program takes developers who know basic programming to building, validating, testing and version-controlling a typed REST API on Node.js in four weeks: 10 modules, about 80 hours. This Solution Design turns the PRD into a buildable plan covering architecture, stack, curriculum, capstone, environment, assessment, delivery and open risks. Its source is `nodejs-developer-training.md`, with versions verified on 2 October 2026.

The design rests on five choices:

- **One running project.** The Task API is built in Module 5 and extended in Modules 7, 8 and 9. The capstone is a separate domain.
- **Language ramp.** Plain modern JavaScript in Week 1, TypeScript from Week 2.
- **Free tools only.** No paid licences and no Docker. SQLite is the only database used hands-on.
- **Real dependencies in tests.** Integration tests run against the exported Express app and a real SQLite database.
- **Pinned versions.** Prisma stays on 7.x, and every cohort starts with a version check.

Items marked **Proposed** are design recommendations the PRD does not state. They need program-owner confirmation (see Risks, gaps and open decisions).

## Goals, scope and success criteria

The program succeeds when a trainee demonstrates all ten PRD competencies and scores 70 or more out of 100 on the capstone.

**In scope**

- Modern JavaScript, async/await, the Node.js runtime and npm
- TypeScript 7 on Node.js
- A REST API in Express 5 with middleware and a central error handler
- SQL on SQLite, and Prisma 7 with migrations
- Zod 4 validation with type inference
- Integration tests with Jest 30 and Supertest, run in GitHub Actions
- Git and a GitHub pull-request workflow, with Bruno for manual API testing

**Out of scope (stated in the PRD)**

- Docker and any paid tool or licence
- Hands-on PostgreSQL or MongoDB. Both are covered as concepts in Module 7, with no labs.
- Prisma 8, which is awareness only

**Not addressed in the PRD (confirm these are out of scope)**

- Authentication beyond a simple API-key middleware
- Deployment or hosting
- Any front end

**Success criteria**

- Every Friday checkpoint is passed against its module checklist.
- The capstone scores 70 or more on the 100-point rubric.
- Each of the ten competencies in the Assessment and validation section is evidenced.
- The cohort completes about 80 hours in four weeks, at about 4 hours a day.

## Audience and prerequisites

The audience is developers new to Node.js who already know basic programming concepts. The PRD assumes nothing more: Git, modern JavaScript, TypeScript and SQL are all taught from first principles in Modules 1, 2, 4 and 6.

| Item | Design |
| --- | --- |
| Duration | 4 weeks, 10 modules, about 80 hours |
| Pace | About 4 hours a day, 5 days a week |
| Daily rhythm (suggested) | 1.5 hours guided instruction, 2 hours lab, 0.5 hour review and Q&A |
| Cadence | A pass/fail checkpoint every Friday |
| Format | Trainer-led cohort with pair work and peer review |
| Learner machine | Windows, macOS or Linux, able to install developer tools including native build tools |
| Accounts | Free GitHub account |

Module 1 sets up the toolchain on Day 1: VS Code, Git, Node through a version manager, Bruno and terminal basics.

## Solution architecture

The solution has two architectures: the learning path that orders the ten modules, and the reference application that trainees build and test.

### Learning path

&#91;embedded content: learning path · 4 weeks, 10 modules, 4 gates\]

Four modules (M5, M7, M8 and M9) grow one Task API from v1 to v4, and the capstone repeats the pattern alone in a new domain.

### Reference application

&#91;embedded content: reference application · request path and error path\]

Bruno reaches the app through `server.ts`, while Supertest calls the exported app directly, so tests need no port. Any step can pass an error to the one central handler, shown by the dashed lines.

**Layer rules**

- `app.ts` builds and exports the Express app and never calls `listen`. `server.ts` listens and shuts down gracefully on `SIGTERM`.
- `db.ts` exports one `PrismaClient` singleton built with the driver adapter.
- Zod schemas live in `schemas/`, and handler input types come from `z.infer`.
- Every error reaches the central handler: `AppError` subclasses set their status, a `ZodError` becomes a 400 with field-level `details`, and Prisma `P2002`, `P2025` and `P2003` map to 409, 404 and 409 or 400.
- Express 5 forwards rejected promises from async handlers to the error handler, so handlers need no try/catch wrapper.

**Error contract (Proposed)**

The PRD requires one consistent JSON error shape but does not define it. This envelope gives the Module 5 checkpoint and the Module 9 tests a single shape to assert. `details` appears only on validation errors.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Request validation failed",
    "details": [{ "path": "title", "message": "Required" }],
    "requestId": "<from the request-ID middleware>"
  }
}
```

## Technology stack

The stack is Node.js 24 LTS, Express 5, TypeScript 7, Prisma 7 on SQLite, Zod 4, Jest 30 and Supertest 7. Everything is free, and versions were verified on 2 October 2026.

| Layer | Technology | Version to teach | Constraint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime | Node.js | 24 LTS now; 26 once promoted to LTS (October 2026) | One version per cohort, pinned in `.nvmrc`. Node 26 adds stable TypeScript type stripping and Temporal on by default |
| Language | JavaScript | ES2023 to ES2025 | Every feature taught runs natively on Node 24+ |
| Language | TypeScript | 7.0 (native compiler, GA 8 July 2026) | No stable programmatic API yet, so tools that embed the compiler need workarounds (Module 9) |
| Web framework | Express | 5.x | `npm i express@5`. Rejected promises in async handlers reach the error handler automatically |
| Data access | Prisma ORM | 7.x, pinned (7.10 at time of writing) | Not Prisma 8: it is a release candidate, its SQLite library is experimental, and its unversioned CLI does not read `schema.prisma` |
| Database | SQLite | Via `better-sqlite3` and the Prisma driver adapter | Single file. `better-sqlite3` is a native module and needs build tools |
| Validation | Zod | 4.x | `npm i zod@4` |
| Test runner | Jest | 30.x | `@swc/jest` transform, ESM mode |
| HTTP testing | Supertest | 7.x | Calls the exported app, so no port is needed |
| Dev runner | tsx | Not pinned in the PRD | Used by the `dev` and `start` scripts |
| API client | Bruno | Not pinned in the PRD | Collections are plain text, committed in `bruno/` |
| Source control | Git, GitHub, GitHub Actions | Current Git 2.x | Free GitHub account |

Four rules follow from the stack:

- **Types are checked by `tsc --noEmit`** (`npm run typecheck`), locally and in CI. The Jest transform only strips types.
- **Zod is the request contract and Prisma types are the persistence contract.** Raw `req.body` never reaches Prisma.
- **Three ways to run TypeScript are taught:** `tsx` as the dev runner, Node's native type stripping (erasable syntax only), and a `tsc` build as awareness.
- **Prisma is always version 7.** Install `prisma@7` and `@prisma/client@7`, lock both to `^7`, and use `npx prisma@7` for one-off commands.

## Curriculum design

Each of the ten modules ends in a lab with a checkpoint, and four Friday gates close the four weeks. The weekly themes are Foundations, Typed API, Data and validation, and Testing and capstone.

Three principles shape the order:

- **Pain before payoff.** The bare `node:http` server in Module 3 motivates Express. Hand-written validation in Module 5 motivates Zod in Module 8. SQL in Module 6 comes before Prisma in Module 7.
- **One concern per Task API version.** v1 adds routing and errors on an in-memory store, v2 adds persistence, v3 adds validation, v4 adds tests.
- **TypeScript after the language basics.** Week 1 is plain JavaScript. Everything after Module 4 is TypeScript.

| Module | Week, days | Hours | Lab deliverable | Checkpoint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 Dev environment, Git and GitHub | W1, D1 | 4 | Public repo with a `hello-node` script: branch, PR, peer review, merge. Pairs resolve a planted merge conflict | Merged PR with 3 or more conventional commits; `.gitignore` and `.env.example` present |
| M2 Modern JavaScript and async/await | W1, D2-4 | 10 | "Async toolkit" ES module: `sleep`, `retry`, `withTimeout`, `mapLimit`; sequential vs parallel fetch timings; callback `fs` code refactored to promises | All `node:assert` self-checks pass; trainee predicts and explains the output order of a snippet mixing `setTimeout`, promises and `await` |
| M3 Node.js runtime and npm | W1, D4-5 | 6 | `log-report` CLI that streams a large file; bare `node:http` server with 3 JSON endpoints | Both programs merged to `main` by PR (Week 1 Friday gate) |
| M4 TypeScript basics and TypeScript on Node.js | W2, D1-2 | 8 | Toolkit ported to TypeScript with generics; Task domain types; a `Result<T, E>` union; run with `tsx` and with native type stripping | Zero `tsc --noEmit` errors on a strict config; explains `unknown` vs `any` and `type` vs `interface` |
| M5 Express: routing, middleware, error handling | W2, D3-5 | 12 | Task API v1: in-memory store, request-ID and logging middleware, central error handler, hand-written validation, Bruno collection | v1 merged by PR; every error path returns one JSON shape; Bruno collection passes (Week 2 Friday gate) |
| M6 SQL fundamentals with SQLite | W3, D1-2 | 6 | Schema for `users`, `tasks`, `tags`, `task_tags`; SQL seed; 20 graded query exercises; Mermaid ERD; SQL injection demo and fix | Exercises complete; explains primary vs foreign keys, what an index is for, 1:N vs M:N |
| M7 Prisma ORM and migrations | W3, D2-4 | 8 | Task API v2: Prisma schema from the M6 design; 2 or more migrations plus one hand-edited via `--create-only`; service layer; filters, sorting, pagination; seed script; Prisma error mapping | `migrate reset` plus the seed rebuilds the database; Bruno collection still green; explains `migrate dev` vs `migrate deploy` |
| M8 Zod validation and type inference | W3, D4-5 | 6 | Task API v3: Zod schemas for create, update, list query and params; typed `validate` middleware; env validation; consistent 400 payloads | v3 merged by PR; no manual `if (!body.title)` checks; invalid input never reaches Prisma (Week 3 Friday gate) |
| M9 Integration testing with Jest and Supertest | W4, D1-2 | 8 | Task API v4: 25 or more integration tests, a GitHub Actions workflow, a coverage report | Green CI on a PR; 80% or more coverage on routes and services; suite passes in random order (`--randomize`) |
| M10 Capstone project | W4, D3-5 | 12 | Independent API in a new domain (see Capstone project design) | Rubric score of 70 or more; 10-minute demo plus Q&A (Week 4 Friday gate) |

## Capstone project design

The capstone (Module 10, 12 hours over Days 3 to 5 of Week 4) has each trainee independently build, test and demo a complete API in a new domain. A score of 70 or more out of 100 passes.

**Domain (choose one):** Library or Bookshelf (books, authors, loans), Expense Tracker (users, categories, expenses), Event RSVP (events, attendees, registrations), Support Tickets (tickets, comments, labels), or Recipe Book (recipes, ingredients, tags).

**Schedule**

- **Day 3:** plan as GitHub Issues, schema and ERD, first migrations, project skeleton.
- **Day 4:** routes, validation, error handling, tests.
- **Day 5:** polish, peer review, 10-minute demo plus Q&A.

| Rubric criterion | Points | Must-have evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Functionality and business rule | 20 | At least 3 models including a 1:N and an M:N relation. Full CRUD for at least 2 resources. One list endpoint with filtering, sorting and pagination. One business rule enforced in a service inside a transaction (for example, cannot loan an unavailable book) |
| Testing quality and coverage | 20 | At least 25 integration tests including error paths. Coverage of 80% or more on routes and services |
| Validation and error handling | 15 | Zod validation for body, params, query and env. A central error handler with one consistent error shape |
| Data layer and migrations | 15 | At least 3 committed Prisma migrations and a seed script |
| TypeScript quality | 10 | Strict mode and zero `tsc --noEmit` errors |
| Git/GitHub workflow and CI | 10 | Issues, then feature branches, then at least 8 pull requests. Conventional Commits. At least one peer review given and one received. GitHub Actions CI passing |
| Documentation and demo | 10 | README with setup steps, scripts, a Mermaid ERD and an endpoint list. 10-minute demo plus Q&A |

The PRD also requires a committed Bruno collection, which has no rubric line. It does not say whether a missing must-have blocks a pass at 70 or more. Both points are in the decision register.

## Environment and tooling setup

Every trainee works in one pinned toolchain, and trainers dry-run Modules 1 to 9 on each OS in the cohort before Day 1.

**Learner toolchain**

- VS Code, Git, Bruno and terminal basics
- Node through a version manager (nvm, fnm, nvm-windows or Volta), pinned by `.nvmrc`
- GitHub authentication through the GitHub CLI, a credential manager or SSH
- `sqlite3` CLI or DB Browser for SQLite (optional), and Prisma Studio

**Repository and configuration conventions**

- Use public training repos, or agree a "no direct pushes to `main`" convention. Branch protection on private repos depends on the GitHub plan.
- `.gitignore` covers `node_modules`, `.env`, `*.db`, the generated Prisma client, `dist` and `coverage`.
- Commit `.env.example`. Never commit `.env` or `.env.test`.
- Validate environment variables once at startup in `config.ts` and fail fast.

**Environment hazards**

| Hazard | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| `better-sqlite3` is a native module and fails to install without build tools | Install build tools first: Windows build tools, macOS Xcode command-line tools, Linux build-essential. Fallback: `@prisma/adapter-libsql` |
| The generated Prisma client is git-ignored project code | Run `prisma generate` after install, after every schema change, and in CI |
| An unversioned `npx prisma` installs the Prisma 8 CLI, which does not read `schema.prisma` | Lock `prisma` and `@prisma/client` to `^7`, use `npx prisma@7`, and hand out `/v7/` documentation URLs |
| Generated Prisma imports may not match the project's import-extension convention | Set the generator's `importFileExtension` option to match the chosen convention |

**Standard npm scripts**

| Script | Command |
| --- | --- |
| `dev` | `tsx watch src/server.ts` |
| `start` | `tsx src/server.ts` |
| `typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `db:migrate` | `prisma migrate dev` |
| `db:deploy` | `prisma migrate deploy` |
| `db:generate` | `prisma generate` |
| `db:seed` | `tsx prisma/seed.ts` |
| `test` | `node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js --runInBand` |

## Assessment and validation

Assessment has three layers, and nine of the ten PRD competencies have a named checkpoint or lab as evidence. Competency 10 has none, and competency 5 covers SQL transactions only in teaching.

| Layer | When | What is assessed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Module checkpoint | End of each module | The checkpoint listed in the module (see Curriculum design) |
| Weekly gate | Fridays: Module 3, Module 5, Module 8, then the capstone demo | Pass or fail against the module checklist |
| Capstone | Week 4, Days 3 to 5 | 100-point rubric; 70 or more passes |

| # | Competency | Taught in | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Explain the event loop and write correct async/await, including parallel work and error handling | M2 | M2 checkpoint: self-checks pass and output order is explained |
| 2 | Structure a Node.js project with ES modules and manage dependencies with npm safely | M3 | M3 checkpoint: `log-report` CLI and HTTP server merged by PR |
| 3 | Build a REST API in Express 5 with routers, middleware and a central error handler | M5 | M5 checkpoint: v1 merged, one error shape, Bruno collection passes |
| 4 | Write strict TypeScript and derive types from Zod schemas and Prisma models | M4, M7, M8 | M4: zero `tsc --noEmit` errors. M8: handler input types come from `z.infer` |
| 5 | Design a small relational schema and write joins, aggregates and transactions in SQL | M6 | M6: 20 graded exercises cover joins, aggregates and pagination. SQL transactions are taught but not in the exercise list |
| 6 | Create, edit and apply Prisma migrations, and explain `migrate dev` vs `migrate deploy` | M7 | M7 checkpoint: `migrate reset` plus seed rebuilds the database; trainee explains the difference |
| 7 | Validate all untrusted input with Zod and return consistent 400 responses | M8 | M8 checkpoint: no manual checks remain; invalid input never reaches Prisma |
| 8 | Write isolated integration tests with Jest and Supertest against a real test database | M9 | M9 checkpoint: green CI, 80% or more coverage, suite passes in random order |
| 9 | Work in a GitHub pull-request workflow with CI | M1, M9, M10 | M9: green CI on a PR. M10: at least 8 PRs and one peer review given and received |
| 10 | Explain what changes when moving from SQLite to PostgreSQL or MongoDB | M7 (concept only) | None. No checkpoint or rubric line tests it |

The PRD also leaves two rules undefined: what happens after a failed Friday gate, and what happens to a capstone under 70. Both are in the decision register.

## Delivery model and roles

A trainer leads each cohort through a fixed daily and weekly rhythm, and trainees work in pairs and as peer reviewers. The PRD names trainers and trainees; the program-owner role is Proposed.

| Role | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| Trainer | Runs the pre-flight checklist before every cohort. Delivers about 1.5 hours of guided instruction a day and supports labs and the daily review and Q&A. Keeps lab solutions free of removed Express 4 patterns |
| Trainee | Completes labs and pull requests, gives and receives peer reviews, builds the capstone independently and presents a 10-minute demo |
| Peer reviewer | A trainee reviewing another trainee's PR: pair review in the Module 1 lab, and at least one review given and one received in the capstone |
| Program owner (Proposed) | Signs off the open decisions, approves version pins for each cohort, and owns the pass and remediation policy |

**Trainer pre-flight checklist (before every cohort)**

Dry-run Modules 1 to 9 on each OS the trainees use, then:

1. Check version drift. Run `npm view <package> dist-tags` for `express`, `typescript`, `prisma`, `@prisma/client`, `zod`, `jest` and `supertest`, and compare with the stack table.
2. Check Prisma 8. Stay on Prisma 7 unless SQLite support is declared stable. Prisma 7 is supported for 18 months after Prisma 8 GA.
3. Confirm `package.json` locks `prisma` and `@prisma/client` to `^7`, and that scripts and CI use `npx prisma@7` where unpinned.
4. Hand out the `/v7/` Prisma documentation links.
5. Test the `better-sqlite3` install on Windows, macOS and Linux. Fallback: `@prisma/adapter-libsql`.
6. Decide Node 24 or 26, run every lab on it, set `.nvmrc`, and match `@types/node` to the major version.
7. Confirm the `@swc/jest` ESM configuration works with the Prisma-generated client. Fallbacks, in order: `ts-jest` with its TypeScript 7 side-by-side setup; TypeScript 6 for the test toolchain only; compile as CommonJS by dropping `"type": "module"`.
8. Choose one import-extension convention and make the Prisma generator's `importFileExtension` match it.
9. Check lab solutions for removed Express 4 patterns, such as wildcard paths and `res.json(status, body)`.

## Risks, gaps and open decisions

Seven items need program-owner sign-off before the first cohort, and the highest technical risk is the TypeScript 7, Jest and Prisma toolchain.

### Decision register

| ID | Decision | Recommendation and reason | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Pin Prisma ORM to 7.x | Prisma 8 is a release candidate with experimental SQLite, and its unversioned CLI does not read `schema.prisma`. Lock to `^7` | Accepted |
| A2 | Transform Jest with `@swc/jest` and gate types with `tsc --noEmit` | TypeScript 7 has no stable programmatic API, so `ts-jest` is a fallback, not the default | Accepted |
| A3 | Integration tests use a real SQLite test database | Separate `test.db`, `prisma migrate deploy` in `globalSetup`, tables cleaned in `beforeEach`, `--runInBand` | Accepted |
| A4 | Free tools only, no Docker, SQLite as the only hands-on database | PostgreSQL and MongoDB stay concept-only in Module 7 | Accepted |
| P1 | Node version for the cohort: 24 LTS or 26 | Start on 24 LTS. Move to 26 only after every lab passes a dry run on it. Native type stripping (Module 4 lab) is stable only in 26, and the install sheet pins `@types/node` to 24 | Proposed |
| P2 | Import-extension convention | Use `.ts` extensions with `allowImportingTsExtensions`. Node's native type stripping needs real `.ts` specifiers, and `.js` specifiers would need a Jest `moduleNameMapper`. Verify in the dry run | Proposed |
| P3 | Task API spec and error contract | Write a one-page spec: Task fields including `status`, the endpoints, whether `users` and `tags` are exposed (Module 6 designs four tables, Module 5 lists only `/tasks`), and the error JSON shape | Proposed |
| P4 | Remediation after a failed Friday gate or a capstone under 70 | Program owner defines who retests, when, and what a trainee under 70 receives | Proposed |
| P5 | Capstone pass rule and the Bruno collection | Treat the must-haves as a gate in addition to the 70-point score, and score the Bruno collection under Documentation and demo | Proposed |
| P6 | Capstone starter and demo format | Capstone needs 3 or more models, 25 or more tests, 3 or more migrations, 8 or more PRs, CI, a README and a demo in 12 hours. The Task API spans 34 module hours (M5, M7, M8, M9), including instruction. Decide whether to supply a starter skeleton (config, errors, middleware, CI), and confirm cohort size so 10-minute demos plus Q&A fit Day 5 | Proposed |
| P7 | Assess competency 10 | Add a short written or oral question on SQLite versus PostgreSQL and MongoDB to the Module 7 checkpoint | Proposed |

### Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript 7 with Jest, `@swc/jest` and the Prisma-generated client fails in ESM mode | Blocks Module 9 and the capstone tests | Dry-run on each OS. Fall back in order: `ts-jest` with its TypeScript 7 setup, TypeScript 6 for tests only, CommonJS |
| `better-sqlite3` does not build on a trainee machine | Blocks Module 7 onward | Install build tools in Module 1. Fall back to `@prisma/adapter-libsql`, which changes the Module 7 install commands |
| Prisma 8 GA is expected in October 2026, and its docs and unversioned installs become the default | Trainees install a CLI that does not read `schema.prisma` | Lock `^7`, use `npx prisma@7`, hand out `/v7/` documentation links |
| Versions move fast: TypeScript 7 went GA on 8 July 2026 and Node 26 reaches LTS in October 2026 | Labs break between cohorts | Run the pre-flight version check before every cohort |
| Capstone scope against 12 hours | Required items are cut or rushed | Decision P6 |
| Modules 5, 7 and 9 each pair a long topic list with a large lab in 8 to 12 hours | Labs overrun the day | Record timings in the dry run and mark stretch topics, such as `express-rate-limit` |

## Assumptions, dependencies and readiness path

The design holds if the pinned versions stay as verified on 2 October 2026 and every lab has a reference solution that passes on Windows, macOS and Linux.

**Assumptions**

- Versions in the stack table stay valid until the pre-flight check, which re-verifies them before each cohort.
- Trainees can install native build tools and reach npm, GitHub and the free public API used in the Module 2 lab.
- Public GitHub repos are acceptable, or the cohort follows a no-direct-push convention.
- The cohort has at least two trainees, because the Module 1 lab and the capstone both use pairs or peer review.

**Dependencies**

- The npm registry and GitHub: repos, Issues, pull requests and GitHub Actions (free)
- Prisma 7 documentation under `/v7/`
- VS Code, Bruno and a Node version manager

**Readiness path to the first cohort (Proposed)**

1. Resolve the Proposed rows in the decision register.
2. Finish a reference solution for every lab: Async toolkit, `log-report` CLI, bare HTTP server, Task API v1 to v4, and one capstone exemplar.
3. Author the supporting materials: the 20 graded SQL exercises with answers, the Bruno collections, and the capstone brief and rubric sheet.
4. Pin versions in `.nvmrc` and `package.json`, then run the trainer pre-flight checklist on each OS.
5. Fix what the dry run finds, then freeze versions for the cohort.
